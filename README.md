# TrigramModel
Trigram model for Natural Language Processing

## Computation
* Extracted n-grams from a sentence
* Calculated raw n-gram probabilities
* Smoothed probabilities using linear interpolation
* Computed perplexity using sentence probabilities

## Evaluation
* Trained two models for text classification of essays for high and low skill level respectively
* Evaluated test data on both models and used perplexity to calculate accuracy
